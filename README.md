### 👨‍💻 About Me

- 🔭 I’ve worked on:
  - `css-craft` — a responsive HTML/CSS site on sustainability 🌿
  - `my_portfolio` — a clean, dark-themed dev site with a cosmic touch 🪐
  - `project_rattlestone` - `a prototype of a moving mini weather station 🚗

- 🚧 Currently building:
  - `RAHOVER` — a working prototype of the Martian rover *Curiosity*, using Arduino and ESP32 🤖
  - `Wireless Communication` — enabling Bluetooth & serial comms between microcontrollers at a larger scale 📶
  - `ESP32 Advanced` - learning more on ESP32 (the absolute development board by espressif)

- 🌱 I’m learning:
  - Frontend Web Dev (HTML, CSS, JS, Git & GitHub)
  - Robotics (Arduino, ESP-32, sensors, hardware integration)
  - Python programming
  - Aerospace & Rocketry fundamentals
    
- ⚡ Fun fact:
  - I designed my first working website at 11 and never stopped tinkering.
  - Also... huge Potterhead 🧙, and obsessed with rovers, rockets & real-world innovation.
